                <h4>Introducing a regulatory assessment tool designed for NIS2 compliance utilizing a unified knowledge model.</h4>
                <p>This tool extends the Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV), providing a comprehensive and standardized set of terms, to conduct a NIS2 gap analysis against the ISO 27001:2022 framework. Each risk-management measure is mapped to specific ISO 27001:2022 controls. Guidance from ENISA outlines a number of essential security controls required for operators of essential services, establishing the minimum required security measures.</p>

                University College Dublin<br>
                The Regulatory Assessment Tool is designed to measure compliance with NIS2 Cybersecurity risk-management measures (Article 21).</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h3 class="section-title">What is this research about?</h3>
            <p>Compliance is assessed through a set of multiple-choice questions that evaluate the effectiveness of the NIS2 in-scope controls. Each risk-management measure was mapped to a number of ISO 270001 controls from the 2022 version and guidance from ENISA defines a number of controls which will apply to operators of essential services. These controls are seen as the minimum required security measures.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3 class="section-title">Why am I doing this research?</h3>
            <p>This research will measure the effectiveness and usability of the NIS2 Regulatory Assessment Tool by assessing the mapping of the ISO Controls to each of the NIS2 articles and requirements, along with the value of the recommendations provided to ensure compliance with the new directive.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3 class="section-title">How will your data be used?</h3>
            <p>The resulting data will be stored as summary tables with numeric ratings for the score and compliance percentage along with the usersâ€™ choices.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
